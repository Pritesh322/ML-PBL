# Impact of mask on face recognition system
Calculate impact of occlusions such as masks, glasses, caps on facial recognition.
A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph. And due to some occlusions some of the features cant be tracked, which will impact facial recognition that we are calculating or interested in.
Face occlusion have been repeatedly addressed in the scope  of face detection solutions. Moreover, developing occlusion invariant face recognition solutions has been a growing research challenge . However, most of these works address general occlusion that commonly appear in in-the-wild capture conditions, such as sunglasses and partial captures. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to study the speciÔ¨Åc effect of wearing face masks on the behavior of face recognition system in a collaborative environment.
